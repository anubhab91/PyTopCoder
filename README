A scraper for the website www.topcoder.com.

Given a problem number, this script downloads all information about the problem from the website, and creates:
 * A directory with the class name and problem number
 * An __init__.py file
 * A .json file with all problem information
 * A .html file with all problem information
 * A .py file (with the method header)

The scraper.py script accepts problem numbers in the form '1,2,3-4'. You can also enter a dash '-', after which you'll be asked how many problems you wish to download. The program will then look through TopCoder problem listings and find problems you do not already have, and download those.
 
The marker.py script needs to be in the subdirectory that contains all the TopCoder problems. It can then, given a problem name or number, automatically run all the tests for that problem.

Includes one TopCoder problem as an example.

Requires:
  * Python 2.7+
  * BeautifulSoup

Features:
  * After parsing, creates a file tc_<problem number>.json with all problem information
  * Saves all examples and tests in JSON-friendly format
  * Comes with an automated marking script, marker.py, which can read the JSON file and mark a TopCoder.com problem attempt written in Python
  * Can be used for building Python TopCoder testing suites
