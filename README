A scraper for the website www.topcoder.com.

Given a problem number, this script downloads all information about the problem from the website and saves it in a JSON file.

Creates a directory with the class name, and creates a __init__.py file, a .json file, and a .py file (with the method header) in the directory ready for editing. The problem can then be marked using the marker.py script which, given the problem name, automatically runs all the tests for that problem.

Requires:
  * Python 2.7+
  * BeautifulSoup

Features:
  * After parsing, creates a file tc_<problem number>.json with all problem information
  * Saves all examples and tests in JSON-friendly format
  * Comes with an automated marking script, marker.py, which can read the JSON file and mark a TopCoder.com problem attempt written in Python
  * Saves problems with the following structure:
{
    'number': None,
    'name': None,
    'statement': None,
    'definition': {
        'class': None,
        'method': None,
        'parameters': None,
        'returns': None,
        'signature': {
            'name': None,
            'returns': None,
            'params': []
        }
    },
    'constraints': [],
    'examples': [], # each example is {'input': [], 'output': None, 'comments': None}
    'tests': [] # each test is {'input': [], 'output': None}
}
  * Can be used for building Python TopCoder testing suites
