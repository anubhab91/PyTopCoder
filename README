A scraper for the website www.topcoder.com.

Given a problem number, this script downloads all information about the problem from the website, and creates:
 * A directory with the class name and problem number
 * An __init__.py file
 * A .json file with all problem information
 * A .py file (with the method header)

The marker.py script needs to be in the subdirectory that contains all the TopCoder problems. It can then, given a problem name or number, automatically run all the tests for that problem.

Includes one TopCoder problem as an example.

Requires:
  * Python 2.7+
  * BeautifulSoup

Features:
  * After parsing, creates a file tc_<problem number>.json with all problem information
  * Saves all examples and tests in JSON-friendly format
  * Comes with an automated marking script, marker.py, which can read the JSON file and mark a TopCoder.com problem attempt written in Python
  * Saves problems with the following structure:
{
    'number': None,
    'name': None,
    'statement': None,
    'definition': {
        'class': None,
        'method': None,
        'parameters': None,
        'returns': None,
        'signature': {
            'name': None,
            'output': None,
            'input': []
        }
    },
    'constraints': [],
    'examples': [], # each example is {'input': [], 'output': None, 'comments': None}
    'tests': [] # each test is {'input': [], 'output': None}
}
  * Can be used for building Python TopCoder testing suites
